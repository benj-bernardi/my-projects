# API Projects

This directory is dedicated to the development and study of API projects built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
It serves as a workspace for learning, testing, and improving backend development skills through practical examples.

---

## Overview

The main goal of this folder is to explore how APIs are structured, how routes and endpoints work, and how servers handle HTTP requests and responses.  
Each project within this space is focused on a specific concept or experiment related to RESTful APIs, middleware, routing, or data handling.

This folder may contain one or more independent projects, each designed for testing and educational purposes.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these studies is to understand:
- How to set up a simple Express server.  
- How to handle routes and responses.  
- The basics of REST architecture and API endpoints.  
- How to organize backend code efficiently.  

Even if there’s currently only one active API here, the structure allows for future additions and experiments as learning continues.

## Requirements

Before running any of the projects here, make sure you have:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)  

To install dependencies for a project, use:
```bash
npm install

Then start the server with:

```bash
node filename.js

## Notes 

All projects within this folder are experimental and made for learning purposes only.
They may change over time as new concepts are tested or as new features are added.
