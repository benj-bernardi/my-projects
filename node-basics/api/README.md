## API Projects

This directory is dedicated to the development and study of API projects built with Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL.
It serves as a workspace for learning, testing, and improving backend development skills through practical examples.

## Overview

The main goal of this folder is to explore how APIs are structured, how routes and endpoints work, and how servers handle HTTP requests and responses.

This folder may contain one or more independent projects, each designed for testing and educational purposes.

## Purpose

Through these studies, you will learn to:

* Set up a simple Express server.

* Handle routes and HTTP responses.

* Understand REST architecture and API endpoints.

* Integrate PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.

* Organize backend code efficiently for maintainability.

Even if there is currently only one active API here, the structure allows for future additions and experiments.

## Requirements

Before running any of the projects, make sure you have:

* Node.js (version 18 or newer recommended)

* npm (comes with Node.js)

* PostgreSQL (version 14 or newer recommended)

**1. Installation:**

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder> 
```
**2. Install dependencies:**

`npm install`

**3. Create the PostgreSQL database and tables:**

Make sure your PostgreSQL database exists and has the necessary tables.
You can use the example projects as reference to create them.

**4. Start the server:**

`node filename.js`

## Notes

All projects within this folder are experimental and made for learning purposes only.

Database structure may change as new features and concepts are tested.

Make sure PostgreSQL is running before starting any server.
