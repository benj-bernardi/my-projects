# Node.js Basics

This folder contains my **Node.js learning projects and experiments**, focused on understanding how Node works behind the scenes — including APIs, HTTP modules, and various built-in features.  
It serves as a collection of small scripts, study notes, and test files created while exploring backend development with Node.js.

## Structure

Each subfolder or file focuses on a specific concept:
- **http/** — tests with Node's built-in HTTP module (creating basic servers, routing, etc.)
- **api-projects/** — experiments/study with REST APIs and JSON handling
- **modules/** — learning about modules

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to:
- Learn Node.js fundamentals step-by-step  
- Practice backend logic and asynchronous programming  
- Understand how Node handles requests, modules, and events  

## How to Run

To execute a file from this folder:
```bash
node <filename>.js
